> Q. Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. 

>> To enable data analytics for a business, I would start by following these steps:

1. **_Define the business objectives_** : The first step would be to understand the business goals and objectives. This would help me to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that the business needs to track.
2. **_Collect and clean data_** : I would then collect data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and APIs. After collecting the data, I would clean and transform it to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **_Choose the right analytics tools_** : I would select the appropriate analytics tools based on the data sources and the business objectives. This could include tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
4. Develop analytics models: Using the chosen analytics tools and machine learning models (like linear regression, logistic regression, clustering models, etc..), I would develop models to analyze the data and identify patterns, trends, and insights.
5. **_Implement and deploy analytics_** : Once the models are developed, I would implement them and deploy the analytics solution to the business.
6. **_Monitor and maintain_** : Finally, I would monitor the analytics solution's performance and maintain it to ensure it continues to provide value to the business.

>> Regarding how to go about gathering requirements, I would follow these steps:

1. **_Identify the stakeholders_** : I would identify the key stakeholders who will be involved in the project, such as business analysts, data scientists, developers and IT teams.
2. **_Conduct requirements gathering sessions_** : I would hold sessions with the stakeholders to discuss their needs, expectations, and use cases. This would help me to understand the business requirements and identify the most important features.
3. **_Document the requirements_** : Based on the requirements gathering sessions, I would document the requirements in a clear and concise format. This would include a summary of the requirements, a list of stakeholders, and a list of identified features.
4. **_Prioritize the requirements_**: I would prioritize the requirements based on their importance to the business and the resources available for the project.
5. **_Refine the requirements_** : Throughout the project, I would refine the requirements based on feedback from the stakeholders and changing business needs.
6. **_Review and sign off_** : Finally, I would review the requirements with the stakeholders and obtain their sign-off to ensure that the project aligns with their needs.
